      <h2>Carpe Diem Act 1</h2>
      <p>24 hours in the Capital city of beer...
        It's midday on a Wednesday, in a tenth-floor office overlooking a frantic
        lunch time rush in the City of London. My manager has just told me that
        I'm going to Belgium with him tomorrow - leaving at 6:50 am and returning
        Friday at 18:15. A rogue thought saunters into my mind and stays there.
        For a moment I gaze out of the window deep in thought, and then I wheel
        my chair back to my desk, open up instant messenger and start typing.

      <h2>Carpe Diem Act 2</h2>
      <p> 24 hours in the Capital city of beer...
        A flurry of atonal chimes brings me to consciousness. Where am I? They pause then start again. What is that noise? I force my eyes open. The melody gets underway a third time.

      <h2>Bar Chart: The Bottle Shop </h2>
      <p>There was once a show called 'Location, Location, Location' about buying property,
        based on an old saying that lists the three most important things about a property.
        I never watched it, but if I was to create a spin-off series about buying bars,
        I would call it 'Beer, Beer, Beer' and buy the Bottle Shop first.
